        <div id="Motivation" class="tabcontent">
          <p>Not only am I passionate about creating beautiful and user-friendly UX/UI, I am also passionate about our Church. The opportunity to bring my creativity, enthusiasm, positivity, flexibility, and knack for organization to a technical role that is focused on Catholic service and faith would be the ultimate blend of my strengths and interests.</p>
          <p>I am most motivated by my desire to improve our world, and I believe that can be accomplished simply by treating others with respect and dignity and by helping and serving them whenever possible. I attended Catholic school from pre-kindergarten through high school, and the focus on service and self-sacrifice helped shape me into the person I am today. My husband Aaron and I met as volunteers at our parish Vacation Bible School (St. Thomas More in Chapel Hill, North Carolina—one of your clients!) and were both North Carolina Teaching Fellows at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. He will continue his career as a high school history teacher as I transition into web development.</p>

        <div id="Background" class="tabcontent">
          <p>Although I am beginning a new career in web development after four years of teaching
          high school English, I have completed an intensive six-month coding and full-stack web
          development boot camp at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (from which I
          also received my undergraduate and master’s degrees) and am confident in my current
          skills and my ability to acquire new technologies quickly. I have been so enthusiastic
          about the skills I’ve learned, I’ve even taught some of the simpler concepts to my
          students in my high school classroom.</p>

        <div id="eCatholic" class="tabcontent">
          <p>When I decided to change my career path from teacher to web developer, one of my
          great hopes was to use my skills to serve the Church, working either at the Diocesan
          level or beyond. The opportunity to “spread the word” as part of my job is something I
          have been looking for and would find immensely rewarding. The modern world requires
          a new kind of evangelization, and I would be honored to be a part of such a wonderful
          Catholic company and to help it live out its mission.</p>

      <p>I was thrilled to learn about your search for a CSS web developer at eCatholic. When I read in the job listing that I could use any medium for the application, I was inspired to do something special to tell you about myself!</p>
      <p>Welcome to my cover-letter site!</p>
